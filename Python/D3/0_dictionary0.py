# Dictionaries - data set, stores keys and values
# they use keys insted of indexes
# they are delcared with curly braces, (like a set but if we declare them as empty, it is presumed, it is a dictionary)
# keys must also be unique

        # value is accessed through a key
        # value can be any type of data

# when I want to loop through a dictionary, I have tu use key instead of i
