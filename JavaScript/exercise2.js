let birthYear = 1986;

let age = futureYear - birthYear

console.log('I will be ' + age + ' in the year ' + futureYear)
console.log(`I will be ${age} in the year ${futureYear}.`) // the backticks and ${} work like f"asdasd{variable}" in Python

// COMPARISONS
// they work similarly to Python but there is a difference
console.log(5 == '5') // true
console.log(5 == 5) // false
